## 2. Generating an API Key

2. Put your API key in the the `API_KEY` variable in the MobileApp/Models/APICaller.swift file.

## 3. Running the App
1. To run the app, use the play button in the upper left corner or press `âŒ˜Command + B` on your keyboard.
2. Wait for the application to build. This will take about a minute.
3. The simulator should open up as a seperate application. If it does not, build the application again.
4. You will have to create an account to get into the main applicaiton, but feel free to use a fake email for now.
